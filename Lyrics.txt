Never worked the night shift because I’m scared of what I might find. I know these ghosts are waiting for the perfect time to become best friends of mine. Never shook a dead man’s hand and I ain’t trying to start. I’m frightened by anything without a beating, living heart.


Some say there's life after death, I say that’s so damn plain to see. I seem to attract the memories of lover’s lost like weeds in a vacant field. So lord help me now,         I’m trying to get some rest tonight. I don’t need to be staring out my window, waiting for such awful times, awful times.


To whomever’s thieving in the night, rest assured your time will come. These ghosts know their way around, they don’t need no kind of ransom. Like lights on the wall, they’ll fill up your room, son, eating up your memory. They gnaw and they consume.

Tracing car tracks back to your house, I was walking by foot, but I was running my mouth. Dodging cars that were headed south, damn girl, I was cussing you out. Com back to me. For someone who says she’s “flying solo,” your eyes are fuzzy and you really don’t know. Better think twice before you make up your mind because I’m on my way to your house, I’m going to make you mine. Come back to me.


He keeps his heart open, but it’s been so hard for him. When love isn’t returned do you just go on? All he wanted was emotion, reciprocated devotion. When love isn’t returned do you just go on?


She said she’d come but then she never came, and if she did she left again and was gone all the same. I guess it’s jealousy or maybe hate, but girl you’re really starting to test my patience. And in the night when the ground had froze, I offered my coat, but I guess you preferred the cold. “I guess I’ll see you soon, though I’ve got not plan. Listen, honey, here comes my man.”


-


This is the part where I don’t do so well. I used to have a confidence in crowds. I won’t leave, I won’t be the first to leave, but I can fade into the background. Can’t help but wonder was it a mistake to move? I guess I do like the sense of anonymity, but weeks pass by and what have I done? I just can’t find my motivation.


This is not what I thought it would be. They say, “don’t wait for your chance, you go out and take it.” Well, I keep going out and I keep falling short. Maybe I have to learn to live with disappointment.


Well, all my friends, they up and scattered. I guess I just miss the good old days. I know I have good times, but I miss the old. Has anyone heard of a time machine?


And if I make it far enough to see my own death, will I remember all my friends and the people I have met? I know I have so much further, but I still want to go back. I want to go back.


-


I was once and honest man, I did everything I could. I wanted you to love me, I never thought that you would. And all my tales of glory, babe, were just my lies built on other lies. I never thought you’d believe me, I never thought you’d be so kind. Now here we are, I’m someone you don’t know.


Believe me when I tell you that I thought of you at every turn. I was crooked, I was nefarious, but to you I kept my word. Now my time has all but past and my crimes were for naught, I gave you that for which you asked me, but never that for which you had want. Now here we are, I’m someone you don’t know.


-


Please help me find my way and if you can’t will you leave me alone? I don’t mind trying and failing, but I’d like to have something to show. Conversations around me sputter, but I keep my compass set due north. And, unless I feel the weather shift, I’m going to sail right around this earth. All this talk of wait and see, maybe so and possibly, I’m not at patient as I was. Best practice what I’ve got say, I’ll hold my breath and fade away. I never even opened my eyes.


Flashback to ten years ago when the lifeboat failed to inflate. Pick me out of a crowd and sell my soul for a poorly lit cave. I’ve got no next of kin. I’ve just got a sword stuck in a stone, and if I can’t get it loose then I guess I’m just on my own.


I’m coming home to you now.


-


These shirts have breath. The only words I have left are so much less than what I'd call apathetic. Bless me for trying, I'll be the face of the asylum. It’s one less party for me to cry from. They told me my psychosis was easily noticed and they asked if I often hear voices. But the ghosts that I see share lips with light speed. They whisper in dangerous tones. And if the clones weren't enough, they've burned my skin black and left my own ransom. Fed through a glass tube, smoked out and blown blue, I'm a child without adult comprehension.


-


If I were a psychic, you’d be on my mind. I’d be drinking all your tea, taking prints for my files. I’d be lining up these cards as my daily routine, hoping that one of these cards I turn would lead you to me. Because I'm so certain you were meant for me.


If I were a Cyclops, I'd keep my eye on you. I'd be so damn focused, my devotion just as true. I’d be lining you up in my sights like Polyphemus to Galatea, a true suitor bound for failure, but love true and famous. Because I'm so certain, I was meant for you.


If I were a cyborg I'd come alive for you. I'd vie for your attention, play baroque music on my flute. I'd name myself Edgar, write you a love song. Hoping they'd make us a sequel and we could be alone.


All these things I'm not, but I'm still a lover. And I'll still focus while we're dancing and on our love.


-


When I'm alone is when I'll sound my best. When I let this darkness roam and howl all through my chest. And because I'm hollow I'll make a good sound. Although, you’ll never hear it because you’re never around


It's not because I miss you. Although I won't lie, I do. It's because I let this aching gnaw and consume. And while my thunder wages war, my lightning will scar. And these mountains will try to contain my miles long arms.


Isn't this the way we left our heads? Always pointed downwards, so blind and reckless. But in my days now I'm so awake I feel bare; so hollow, so shallow, so rabid, so scared.


-


I was waiting for your van to arrive, I didn’t know the time only the place. Until the sun sets west of my problems here, I was in love with the human race. And in Texas vestige messages encoded with sweet saccharine. It was time to change my mind so I turned my lies around.


If it’s love, if it’s love, if it’s love that I feel, we got something now.


Tank tops and some flip flops, we got lost in the rain and had you not opened your mouth and spoke I would’ve assumed that you were sane. Oh, but you did, and I did, and that was the last thing that I recall until the tidal wave fell over us both while we were crashing in Pall’s Mall.


If it’s love, if it’s love, if it’s love that I feel, we got something now.


If Nintendo was our travelogue, well I’m not sure what game we played, but you were always there beside me when I was rabid and so scared. I never knew that I could sound so dumb, I didn’t know my fingers could cheat, but you were quick to point it out, still you eyes never stopped loving me.


But it’s not love, it’s not love, it’s not love that I feel, and you got nothing for me.


-


Broken skin and hollow bones, winding through these weeds. Yellow smoke and holy rolling, my heart is tumbleweeds. And my feet ain’t moving so fast because I can’t seem to get up off my back. I’m breathing heavy, am I ready for another winter?


Tired of waiting, I’m so impatient, and I’m all dressed in black. Sugar’s sweet and my tongue’s been freed, now I’m damned at last. And my feet ain’t moving so fast because I can’t seem to get up off my back. I’m breathing heavy, am I ready for another winter?


-


Time has no patience, so why, ever why should I? All of the trees and all of the seasons make it so futile to try. But if fighting makes me a man, well, then I guess I’ll just keep on kicking. You may hate it, but I know now other way, it’s something I’ve been missing.


Brother there’s a choice to make here, though it feels this choice might make you. You are still you and you always will be, these choices just help set us free. So go ahead and do what you have to do. Yes, there might be some hurting. But life ain’t living without any pain, so go ahead and hurt me again.


Someone gave my momma cancer. Yeah, I’d like to chat with him. Someone told me he already had it, but I’d like to see him do it again. Yeah, I guess I’m mad. My face falls in my hands.
These nightmares spread and I can’t sleep.


-


I believe, I think we both know that. Do you believe and are you even sad?


So, we both walked here, but somewhere I lost my strength and left you to live and grow. I taught you to never look back and never think about how I’m still here. God, I swear all I do is try. I guess I’ll try to disappear; I’ll walk away, close the door, close my eyes. I’m barely alive, but I know how to hide.
No, I don’t have superpower, but I thought you’d stay longer than you did. Oh, but I can’t call you a liar. I set you up and boy did you deliver. And left me to wonder, why do I always feel so damn alone? In a house full of my friends and all I really want to do is just go, but I’ve got no way to leave without someone seeing me.


I’m sorry, I know it’s petty, but I can’t change how I feel. And I know you’re just trying, so I’ll get out of your view.


-


You said you’d rather be lonely. I said, “what does that mean? Have you found your one and only? I just keep finding dreams.” In this frail disguise I call my life, well I hope that it leaves when I’m gone. Oh, when I’m gone.


You said you’d rather be lonely. I said, “what does that mean? It seems I think of you only, but I just keep failing dreams.” If this ship sets sail, I hope I’ll be there because I don’t want to lose sight again. No, not again.


-


I have loved and lost. They say, “the reward is greater than the cost.” But I’ve been up and beaten down and I don’t know if I’ll pick myself back up off the ground. Oh, love it hurts.


This is not the first time. I don’t know if I’ll ever learn. This is not a test, but I still got burned.


-


It’s been seven years since I started this whole civil war. The poison’s filled me up, but I ain’t seen a dime. And my mama said, yeah, my mama said that I could leave this town. Well, my bags are packed, but my feet never left the ground.


What’s mine spilled out on the floor and these webs spun violently have now all grown cold. What’s mine? I guess I’ll never know. I am impatient and probably a drone.


So tell me again what I think I already know. They said it’s impossible with blood, only probable with bone. So, they call my name with trumpets dressed in chrome. And they call my name, they call my name home.


Beacons of light follow me home. This breeze in the night will follow me home.
I know I’ve got some problem you don’t want to see, but I swear I’m not that bad, it’s just you were bad for me. So bad for me.


They took half my age and subtracted it all from me. Counting back from zero, I ended up at bleed. Now the love that returns it steals my drafts from me. I got my sword back, but I’m waiting for my stone.

He says he sees red lights on the wall late at night. And he hears them call. They’re searching for the boy who always does himself wrong. But, he is more concerned about his health, the ulcer that the police left while they were trying to extract the demons from his heart.


He’s just trying to get along. Singing the words to his own song. He’s doing alright, but not for long. He’s going to get some help real soon.


He’s a problem with his only friend, the one following him home again, because that friend’s trying to steal the treasure from his trust. And, oh he’s a sad one, he never wants from noone. He sure doesn’t want no help from me.


He’s just trying to get along. Screaming the words to his own song.


-


I swear I used to know how to love. I swear it never was this hard. Somehow I lost that part of me. Maybe if I could remember how to feel again. Listless and then I sleep all day. Emotionless I wish you’d just go away. I wish I could remember to have but, but instead I’m annoyed by everyone. 


Take me away from here, help me forget my own name. I want to feel that again. I know I can feel that again.


I used to be captain of the joke team. Now, it seems I am my biggest joke. I called up joke hotline to see, but all my best friends just laughed at me. I guess it’s cool to know I’m cool in all my favorite games. I know I can’t be perfect. Who would ever want that?


-


If I were alone, would that change how you feel? And if I were a gnome, would that break our deal? Because I don’t want to be alone, no, I don’t want to be alone no more. And if I knew every word, I’d spend my whole life writing you a poem. And if I knew every girl, I’d spend my whole life waiting for you. Because I don’t want to be alone.


Because everyone is talking loud and they’re starting to drown you out. Everyone is talking loud and I can’t even hear my mouth.
-


The devil lives here in the cold. I can’t sleep, no, I don’t sleep so well here anymore. He’s always talking about the snow, whispering about the cure. What’s the matter with folks these days, can’t they listen anymore? He’s out on the streets again, now, he’s raising hell. If you want to stop him well then just go ahead. I’m seven hundred miles between what I should and shouldn’t do. I should really stop myself, but I can’t see the use. 


Do the problems remain? Am I just setting myself up for losing odds on a losing game?


The devil lives here in the snow. I can’t sleep, no, I don’t sleep so well here anymore. He’s always talking about the cold, whispering about the cure. I’ll head out west just to digress, I guess I’ll play those slots some more.

Ain’t nobody's equal. Ain’t nobody's the same. This man has so many demons, and this man has none, so who’s to blame? This man misses his mother, misses his dad and three brothers. He is so grief stricken that he don’t even think about quitting. This man misses no one so who’s to blame? Who’s to blame? This man is so grief stricken he don’t even think about quitting. And this man is sober, so who’s to blame?


He cries, “I want them back. Mom and dad, my brothers, Alvin and Max.” He slouches in his chair, his emotions running everywhere. He cries, “I want them, I just want them back.” Who’s to blame? We’re all the same, Lord, we’re to blame. If we can’t help our own, well, it’s a long, long, lonely road. Lord, we’re to blame because we’re all the same. We’re all the same.

It seems that I’m a dreamer, but what am I dreaming of? These things are real; this song I’m singing, the things I’ve been scheming up for you. So do I just stop believing, keep on dreaming? What do I do? Because the this time I’m feeling tied up to you tonight. I’m tied up tonight.


If the wind blew harder tonight and this ferris wheel turned to a fire, it’d light the night sky with all this love.


Rabid and so wild, like a lost dog I’ve tried and I still circle you. With every step I take, make sure to breath straight. I’m looking for you. 


If the wind blew harder tonight and my love turned to a fire, it’d scorch this valley looking for you. If thoughts can make me weak and seeing you can bring me to my knees, my heart is failing looking at you.


-


Make some room in your heart. A little humanity, show. The nights are long and some of us won’t get to go home at all. The religious man says he can help with my soul, but when he turns and curses our own, he left my soul in the cold. 


No, I’m not speaking for everyone. I’m just speaking my mind.


To the man on his way to work, wrapped up in his daily news. He looks and he dreams just like me and you, but he’s blind to what this world could really use. 


I’m not sure what anyone did to deserve what they got. If it’s arbitrary, to me, that’s so scary and I guess I lucked out a lot.


-


I blew the top part of my mind, windswept and bone dry. Lord knows he needs you home, but I need you here. Nothing feels the same, no memories lost, no memories gained. But, I’m dreaming again. So, what do we do? Sit here and wait for the day when our days will be through Nothing feels the same, but I’m dreaming again.


It doesn’t mean that the world goes on spinning. It doesn’t mean that we’ll all go on living. It doesn’t mean that I change how I feel. It doesn’t mean anything.


You blew the bottom of the barrel, out and back towards time. There ain’t nothing that ain’t mine. I’m dreaming again. And all I see is right, tell me what is mine. These long days and touchback nights? I’m dreaming again. So why are we here? To experience this pain, to experience this hate? I’m dreaming again. And I know the dreams ain’t real, but that’s not how it feels dreaming again.


-


Go ahead and shoot me now, put the noose around my neck. I’ll leave the choosing up to you so I can get some rest. I laughed at my convictions, shouldn’t that make me insane? I just keep on laughing, but the visions returned again. Sitting in a room with no furniture at all. It’s just me and my guitar and a lamp to light up this dark. When I forget to talk, I sing, but I sing with such great folly. I’ve never been too good at anything, but melancholy. 


The river froze deep, harder than I’ve ever seen. And hands fall asleep, busier than I’ll ever be.


If I had to chose for me, I think I’d chose the left. Left in mind and spirit, but what’s left lacks kind temperament. I’m not saying I’m poor, though sometimes I do get lonesome, and when people talk about their home, brother, I’ve got no place to go.


-


Haunted by these ghosts, sworn to keep me safe. Oh, the clouds and devilish rain, you should hear the vulgar things they say. I’m haunted by these ghosts and I don’t care. Haunted by my fears, the ones that keep me here planted where I am. All the things I’ve become. I’m haunted by these fears and I don’t care. Oh, they run from me. Oh, they come to me.


Is it any wonder why we all grow? Will we come back? No one really knows. I don’t, I’ll never know.


-


I’ve been swerving a long way. So reckless, I should be dead. They told me that I live the wrong way. They think there’s some cobwebs on my shelves.


If you could save yourself, would you walk out on your friends? I’ve decided to stick this thing through to the end. So, won’t you stay with me, my friend?


I’ve failed so many of my friends, the people that I care for. If I’m not someone on whom you can depend then what am I living for?


If you had to die to save somebody else, would my name come to mind? I know I’d die for you and I’d live to give you my best. You’re a true friend of mine.


-


I vaguely remember those days when seasons of sadness seemed so far away. When dreams were kind to fill my mind and love pumped through my heart. I could smile all day long and sing happy songs, now I just want to restart. What did I miss? When did I wake up and feel like this?


Find me at the north pole. Find me at the south pole. Find me in a hole. You won’t find me anymore.


I think I just lost control. Suddenly, I feel so unstoppable. My mind is racing. Who knows how I got to this place? I think I own the world. Now, I’m full of charm, I’ll hold you in my arms. I’m in love with every girl. Am I crazy? Do you think I’m insane?


You can have me over for dinner and fork out my brains.


-


I tried so long, I prayed so hard to quit. It seems useless. I’m getting sick of this shit. My friends all think that I’m an honest guy. Man, would they be surprised to know I’m living a lie. 


It’s all downhill from here. I could not help myself, you got to run away from me. It’s all downhill from here. I could not help myself, you got to run away from me.


I’ve been thinking I’ll take a break for awhile, at least until I die. I’m barely alive. It’s been awhile since you talked to me my dear. What can I do to repair all of my errors?


And this cold is really getting to me now. I have to find a way to warm up somehow. It’s not like I don’t try to be the best I can. Sometimes you can never be all that you want. When life gets tougher, most people get tougher. When I life gets rough, that’s when I start to suffer.


-


Please, whatever you do, don’t forget me. Remember the days when we used to laugh? It seems those times are slipping through the cracks. Oh, how I wish I could make them last, but time won’t pause and time won’t let you go back. 


So take it step by step. Lean on me if you need a rest and I swear we’ll make it there.


I know you can be happy without that. It seems so long since I last saw you laugh. I know I can’t be happy knowing that I left you on the wrong path. 


So take hold of my hand. I will guide us to dry land where I swear we’ll make it there.


Please don’t live too fast, you know you can’t go back. One day, you’ll look at your path, spots might be black, but you shadow has been cast.


So grab onto my shoulder, we’ll be together as we get older. And I swear we’ll make it there.


-


My friends say you’re playing me. I know that’s how it feels at times, but I’d like to think I know you better than they do. Oh man, I’m praying I do. If I was ever to get hurt it sure would hurt a lot worse coming from you. Darling, please don’t patronize me. Or maybe it’s just that you forgot. Don’t you’re not the first that one who has lied to me, no, it happens regularly. Still, getting hurt sure hurts a lot worse when the hurting is your dishonesty.


-


It’s not that hard to see all of my needs when I’m down on my knees begging, “baby, oh baby, oh please. Baby, let’s head back to the east.” I’m sending wishes and kisses. Girl, you know I’ll miss this. And I’m still right here if you need me, waiting right here if you do. Send him away.


-




Tell me where to find relief. Is seeing you all I need? I’ll try to cross this street, but it’s awkward being me. I do believe it’s for those eyes, it’s the light pouring from your smile, it’s from your beauty I just can’t, it’s love, I know, I won’t deny. I think we could’ve made it big, but, babe you kept your feelings hid. I realized all of it too slow. By then I was our biggest joke. No more pretending there’s me and you, it’s sad because we were so cute. I’ll blow my nose and tie my shoe, try to forget, walk a different avenue. 


I’m growing old, I’m growing grey. I grow more immature every day. Don’t try to change my mind, I won’t stop sleeping until I find a fountain that will keep me youthful, gold in the earth and in the sea a pearl full of worlds where peas and carrots will eat me. I’ll fly with the wind and narcissistically think only of myself and how I’ll achieve great wealth. If only I could find keep you, a digital copy and an analog, too. If not, I’ll fade away and keep growing old and cliche. You said you are out of it and that’s why I’m throwing this fit.


-


Take me to Vegas one more time. I swear I’m not crazy. I still don’t think I’m over you, but maybe I never want to. Let’s leave on another trip. I can’t get enough of this. It’s going to be a long time before the sun from where I am. So, let’s take our time to get out of the crossfire. Because I’m feeling like I’m under fire, or maybe I’m just feeling tired. Tired of all the shit that I’ve been told to listen to.


It’s been awhile since I’ve been fun. I swear I’m not crazy. You know you make me feel like me, I guess I forgot how to be happy. I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately, I swear I’m not crazy. Where do you think you’ll be? It hurts to think of you away from me. 


-


I can’t wait to fall back asleep to find you dancing with me. You will fall back in my arms, we’ll fall asleep in our dreams. And when I finally awake, I’ll wipe the sleep from my face and chase the pieces of you through the haze of this lonely day in my room. And even when you are away I still whisper your name. I think it’d provide a little relief if I could only hear you breath. Please, you are all I need. I like how I feel when you are with me. You will always be my shooting star, girl, I just hope I can end up where you are.


I don’t think I’ll ever understand how I got as lucky as I am to come across such a lovely face, I think you’re gorgeous in every way. It makes me sick when you leave, I wonder will you forget me. I know you’re beautiful and I’m not the only one who can see.


And when things aren’t going my way, thoughts of you brighten my day. I think you have that effect on most, even those you don’t know. Although, I think you do know I will not just let you go. This time I am playing for keeps, but for now let’s just fall back asleep.


-


Logic sits waiting, comfortable and contently clueless. A cushioned chair and blank stare at his newspaper tell the story of his inexperience. His shoes are travel-free, completely new. Meanwhile, nasty gnats of alabaster swarm my mind. They cloud carelessly, eclipsing my sanity, building up in a mound. 


What’s left? An annoyance? A light left lingering at the end of its life? An understanding, finally understanding that understanding myself simply does not happen in a single night. It’s refreshing, I suppose, to know that in life what’s most true and beautiful is illogical, indefinable, and so indescribable. Because it doesn’t take a rocket scientist, I think he’d be too dense, to know the human experience doesn’t always make sense.


So stay inside logic, remain recumbent, embrace your new life of erasure. Maybe the sky’s not blue, it’s azure. Shrug off all those heavy burdens that represent, to so many people what’s truth, because there’s no way on earth that you can take my intrinsic my worth. No way on earth you’ll steal my youth.


-


Winter months are cold and lonely if you got no one to hold. You can always keep warm by your fire. The winter gets so cold, it gets so cold and lonely. Let me be your fire. Every single month is cold, every month I miss you most. Let me be your fire.


-


Hey, it’s tomorrow and I still love you. Didn’t I say that I would? Hey, it’s tomorrow and I still miss you. Didn’t I say that I would? I know that you’ve been thinking about it. You’ve got so many things to worry about. Do your best not to think about it, my love for you is true.


Raise your bow, girl, and draw that string, girl. You shot me right in the heart. Like strings on my guitar, when we’re stretched taught, we play in harmony. So forget this place and sing with me. There’s so many songs that we could be singing. And try not to worry about it, my love for you is true.


If you’re down, I’ll help you to your feet. If you need me now, I’ll run to where you’ll be.


-


I was headed back home through the prairie land, I was crossing that desert land and that desert sand when a storm kicked up and swept me away. I’ll be riding this tornado all the way home. They told me that this is no way to live. I can’t be living life with clenched fists. So I got to up and leave, I’m out on my own, I going to find myself a brand new home.


Wake up early just so I beat the heat. Ride up every night, stay up to howl at the moon. It’s a hard life when you’re on the run.


I’m going to find me a girl, faithful, young, and true, to kiss me, and hug me, and say, “I love you.” She won’t mind if I gamble, cheat, or swear. She’ll just lean over and say, “watch your temper, dear.” And when I die I want my tombstone to say, “this was the roughest riding cowboy of our day. We loved him well, but now he’s gone. He’s riding that tornado to his heavenly home.

I can’t say if I’ve felt worse than this, but I know that I’ve felt better. I used to feel like a sunny day, now I just feel like rotten weather. It’s a hard way I’ve got to live. I’m not saying I’m alone in the world, but I don’t like feeling this. They said with the help of my medicines they could make me feel well again. I’d rather take a walk with you my friend because when it comes to life you understand things. So, won’t you come along with me? We could run away and just live naturally. 


If I had a chance I’d take it because, you know, I think I could make it. Out on my own just living peaceful, I just need a place to rest my feet. A grassy spot for me to lay on, a pretty girl for me to dream on, my guitar for me to play, and that sweet girl to sing me songs.


They told me that this is no way live that I have got to fix this. I said, “I’m going to do just what I please,” because I think I know what I need. I just need you. I just need you for my medicine, I just need you. I’ve been on every drug you see and nothing seems to work for me. I’ve got to try something new, like you, because, so far, you’ve been my only cure. So won’t you fix me, change me please? All I need is your sweet loving and I’ll live happily.

That’s the story as I’ve been told. I swear I’m telling you all I know. You say it sounds crazy. I’m promise you, that’s exactly what it is. And I missed the most beautiful thing I could ever feel, I could have ever dreamed. It’s love. 


In the mirror this man’s yelling at me. I can’t understand, he won’t speak clearly. I wonder what’s next, he’s running his finger across his neck. If I had my choice I’d change everything. Instead of my mind, I’d lose my memory and just leave this place. I’d leave all the fields blank. And I’m waiting. Take my body away to another place, to another day, where I can love. Where I can love. Where I can be loved.

Everything was great, everything was right, but I fell and now I can’t get up. The whole world just collapsed and I want to go back. What do you do when you’re too lonely tell a friend that you need help? And all you can feel is low? And good times don’t seem to ever show? Is there a magic spell to use to make me feel well again? I would pay so much money to find it now. If I find it later it might be too late. Because the way things are going, I’m going away.


Have you ever had that feeling inside that you wish you could die? You wish could hide? And no one seems to understand? Who can you talk to when you’re alone? Is there a magic spell to use to take away these blues? I’d pay so much money to have it now. The way things are going lately, it might be too late, for me.

Build it up so high, my rocketship is going to touch the sky. You were the first, were the last, were the only one. Now that you’re gone, well, I’m not fun. So take me back to the beginning, I’m going to retrace all my steps tonight. Take me to the ending, I’m going to find out why we’re not friends.


Give me your lemons, Clementine. I know I’m sweet, but I like your sour kind. And if we’d mix, we’d speak Chinese. Clementine, oh baby, please.


Put me down so low, my nose is pressed against the floor. I might get up, but for now, the only thing I’m up for is feeling down. I won’t go back to the beginning, it’s much too far for me to go. So instead I’m moving on to a new place and time. After a while, I’ll be just fine.


-


I’ve been shaking in my skin for weeks, trying and fighting to get some sleep. So, I jumped out just in my bare bones and left my skin back at my home. You know, I think it just misses your touch, and you know, I think I do too. Is that a crime? You left today to go back to the city. You smiled and waved and said, “don’t you forget me.” I said, “if I traveled south, north, east, or west you’d still be the girl I love the best.” “Do you swear?” “Give me your hand. Yes, I swear, I’m going to be your man.”


If the city lights blind you, and if you get lost, I promise I’ll come and find you and sing for you this love song.


It’s how you think, smile, laugh, and talk, I’m not giving you up at any cost. When I’m with you I’m just happy and that’s just the way I want to be. I believe, when I’m with you, I can be anything.


If you’ve got a secret to tell, I promise I’ll keep it well. If you need a friend, I promise I’ll be there until the end.


-


Keep my chin up, I can’t because it’s lazy. Help me keep my vision, it’s fading away. Is there something I’m missing? I can’t get it out of my head, I guess I’m just feeling like I’ve fallen off the shelf. Just let me lay here in my bed. 


Answers to my life are painted in your eyes and when you blink I remember why I’m alive. Secrets to my soul are written on your hands and when I hold them I think that I understand that I’m just a kid.


I scare myself half to death and I’m going crazy, couldn’t you guess? I’m not there, not yet. Dark clouds are coming, I see them, but I don’t mind. I got you right here on my side and that’s just where I want to be.

I knew this boy, fixing to lose. He let his heart go and now his heart’s on the loose. I saw him in the mirror, he looked pretty glum. I asked him what was wrong, he said, “my heart’s on the run. I got no heart, like a sky with no sun. And it’s getting hard because I get lonely some. I swear that I looked everywhere for that son of a gun. If I don’t find what’s lost soon, I could lose you, too.”


“I know you’re sad, you’re feeling blue. Don’t you worry, love, I’m giving my heart to you. Take my heart and put it use, but I’m going to need all of your love because I’m giving all of mine to you. You got my heart and, honey, I got you. I know it will be hard, but we can make do. If we choose, we’ll make it through. Just give me your love while I give mine to you.”


“It’s getting dark,” “but I’ll stay up with you.” “We’re worlds apart,” “but we’re one and not two.” “So stay close to me and I’ll stay close to you.” “If you’re leaving soon, I’m coming, too.”

Takes one to know one lover. I don’t think I know any other. I guess I’m just waiting for the sun to rise. I feel I’ve gone missing brother. What’s left for me to uncover? I surely do miss all of my highs.


But doctor said it’s best to keep those highs under control. The solution has got me feeling pretty low.


What’s that tune Matt’s humming, memories got me feeling something so I pick up the guitar and start to ramble. Aubryanna says she likes my strumming. Maybe I’m just scared of nothing. Still my brainwaves are sailing on a different channel.

Started writing his life with his left hand, got stuck with this girl who turned him all around. Now, he’s seeing stars. I had a friend up until last week. He said, “you’re curse, get away from me, and leave me be.”


When it’s cold it will snow. He’s got this feeling that she already told him so. She’ll make the jokes and he can laugh. I don’t see a problem in them living their lives like that.


He was diseased, he knew he was. She said, “I don’t care because I am too.” The ending burst from the inside out. It took some time, but they’re both melodies in this song.


When it’s cold then I’ll know. I’ll wrap you up tight, love, and I won’t let you go. I’ll make the jokes and you can laugh. I don’t see a problem in living our lives like that.

Woke up Sunday morning with no way to hold my head. Found out Monday morning that my only love was dead. Held her but the rigamortus held tighter instead. I can’t believe the sound it made when I trimmed off her head.


In our heads we can be galactic. In our heads we can be collected. In our heads we can be epileptic. In our heads be galactic.


Woke up Sunday morning and I could not find my head. Sunday morning anthrax laced my only lover’s bed. Took my clothes off and kissed my only lover goodbye. Filled the tub and soaked myself in formaldehyde.

Turn the water up hot, I’m going to melt off my skin, wash off these memories, and burn up my sins. I’ve got to forget these things and what they mean. I see the dark clouds coming, but I’ll just hide again. Fortune smiled briefly, but now it’s left me in a hole. I’d climb out myself if I cared, but I don’t. I’m staying right here until someone finds me where I am, reaches out and grabs me, pulls me up and helps me to stand. 


The thing about it is, it don’t matter what I do. I could climb this mountain and still not be over you. That’s the truth, what do you want me to do? I’ve got all the proof, what do you want me to do? I know I fight my own battles. I know this is all in my head.


This book tells me not to read and so I’m trying to stay awake. I’m free like America and I’m trying to escape. I’ve got to leave here. Just leave me behind. If I could leave without a trace, it’ll all be fine. I wish I were a drinker I would drink up all these years, swallow it like medicine to roll back the tears. It feels just like I’m looking at a magic eye. You stare long and hard and that’s when the shit appears.


The thing about it is, and I really don’t care, you say I’m headed nowhere. I say, “that’s somewhere.” But, you know I’m through living like this. They told me that I got to fix it and now I did.

Beautiful girl just in a lonely town. She’s just bumming around, at least for now. She flips her hair and flags a taxi down. She says, “I’m leaving this town, at least for now.”


Yeah, she’s leaving and she’s never coming back. She’s got a ticket in her hand, she’s got her boarding pass. Yeah, I’ll miss her. Oh man, I’ll miss her. So I’m blowing kisses and wishing on the stars to bring her back to me.


“Well boys, it’s time that I go home to where the fireflies glow and don’t make a sound. In the forest where pines and evergreens grow and when I fall down I don’t make a sound.”


“You know I’m headed for the coast. I’m swimming out to an island so no one knows where I am. Be by myself and sing sad, sad songs. The kind where no one sings along because they don’t know the verse.”


Yeah, she left and she never coming back again. Did you hear last night that she took her life? I’ll miss her, oh man, I’ll miss her. So I’m blowing kisses and wishing on the stars to bring her back to me.

Karley said I can’t love that girl again. I’ve got to keep my head screwed tight on my shoulders. I told her, “it’s not that easy, my friend. When everything she does it just drives me wild.


It’s just so hard for me when it feels so real and I’m sorry I still believe.


I’m afraid how I loved you then is how I love you now. I can’t stop loving you, babe, because I don’t know how. I asked my friend Karley for advice, she said, “don’t do it,” but, loving you feels so nice.


It’s just so hard for me when it feels so real and I’m sorry you don’t believe.


So I’ll lay down here on my back just trying to get all my thoughts to relax. When that doesn’t work to clear my mind, I think of us as your hand is holding mine.


It’s just so hard for me when it feels so real and I’m sorry we don’t agree.

You drink the poison down, you’re drowning yourself. You don’t realize, but I do. You lay dying. You crack a smile, you don’t know why, but you do. And you breathe your last breath and you’re at rest. Because life has let you down, you’ll drink another round.


Your voice is smoke. You cough and you choke as you fight to breathe the air. You wheeze and curse as you light up your third and you swear to yourself, “life has let me down.” So you burn another down.


You are just a kid. You’re only a kid. Kid, you’re my best friend.

Mother, may I more love more true, remember to say all my please and thank yous, and be more grateful for the sky when it is blue. Mother, may I live more like you, embrace my friends and enemies, too, and love until I’m worn through. 


Please don’t leave me alone. Tonight it looks like I’m on my own.


Mother, the world outside is such a wreck. There’s people yelling, hating, and I’m such a mess. I ask myself what could be next. Mother, I found myself in a rut. I’m so far down I feel like giving up. I guess this boy can only take so much.


Mother, I’m feeling awfully blue. Is there anything you or anyone else can do? Because I don’t know if I’ll make it through. Mother, I can feel the weight of the world It’s all around me, it’s everywhere I turn. Tell me now, what’s the lesson I’ve to learn. 


-


I felt I owed this song to you, an apology deep from within. I know I haven’t been that bright, shining star for you. I know I’ve been pretty dim. 


But, I’m burning a hole in my heart for you, somewhere your image will remain. And even though you don’t love me like I love you, I know we’ll be friends for all time.


I know I made many mistakes, I may have even broken your heart. I’m sorry for all the times I wronged you and made us fall further apart.


But, I burned a hole in my heart for you. It’s somewhere your image will remain. And even though you don’t love me like I love you, I know we’ll be friends for all time.

I’m slowing things down in my life. I just met a girl, I really fell for her, but I’ve got to leave her behind. 


When I think about it, I laugh about it. Not because I think it’s funny, just because I think I’ve seen a lot of bad days. Then, I hit this spot of luck and I’ve managed to muff it up again. I’m trying so hard to believe. All my dreams were just stars, I swallowed them one by one until I had them all. Now, it’s so dark.


They told, “it’s no way to live.” I shouldn’t live like this, but I did. I said, “it’s my life. I’m feeling fine. I feel alright.”


-


I’m so tired, I haven’t slept in a couple of days and the sun seems to darken the shadows on my weary face. My problems are not mine. I’ve given them up over time. Now, help me get some rest for my health.


I just saw a ghost. I wonder if he knows I know. And I can’t help but wonder, when I die will I move that slow? Because sometimes I can not wait to live my life at a slower pace. I’m just trying to catch up to my breath.


So if you see me sleeping, please do not wake me. Just leave me sleeping, I need to catch those Zs. You could curl up beside, lay your arm across me. Maybe you could catch some Zs of your own.


-


I’ll poke you in the eye and you tell me if you can see. I can see no wrong in you and now you see none in me. Tell me, would you love me if I gave you my heart? There’s no need to give it back again, this is my last hand of cards. I give up.


I know I can’t win. I’m on my second wind. I just hope to catch up, but you’re so far ahead. You moved on.


I can feel the changes, everyone I know is insane. You can read my mind, you know I’d like to turn back time to those days.


My hands love to tell stories, my eyes do all my talking, I just like to whistle, I let my legs do the walking. For five dollars a day, my sanity is secured. I swallow twice, my friend, just so I can make sure it goes down.


I just hope to catch up, but you’re so far ahead. Please, wait up.


Read me a bedtime story, one that’s full of lies. Planes swimming in oceans and stars that are shooting the sky. They say if you make a wish it will always come true, but how come I’m still alone and I’m not with you? It don’t make sense.


I just hope to catch up, but you’re always so far ahead. Where are you headed?


-


The rain outside washes off my skin when the waking wind shouts out from within. It seems my sanity has worn thin, just judging the colors of this black and white film. I finally found out that I’ve been lost and that I hate the words in all my songs. They say the right reel will come along one of these mornings on my midnight run. 


If the light can see through the black and my heart won’t have an attack and you’re just at you home. You whisper into the night, “oh babe, I want to try.” Don’t you know you’re not alone?


If I can have psychotic delusions and manic depressive confusion, just tell me babe why I can’t have you. If I can see the oxygen, babe, and I can see the radio waves, just tell me girl why I can’t see you.


It’s been so long since I’ve had a dream, but then again my whole life is so surreal. I can’t tell if I’m sleeping or awake, if I’m really here or if I’m away. I fold myself inside my bedsheets during the night, when I awake there’s wrinkles in my soul, ink stains when my heart explodes.


I watch the words as out they float and I place bets on which one of them knows the way to your lips. I close my eyes tight and pray and read your lips as you say, “come on over here and get your kiss.”


If I can have psychotic delusions


-


I can see my words. I’m eating things I’ve never heard of. I’m talking to these birds, they’re telling me to fly the coop on this world. I’m choking back these pills. My mind is trying to kill me. I’m choking back the thrills, lapping up the poisons to heal me.


String me up in heaven. String me up by my toes, string me up all alone, string me up so no one knows.


I see a man with no shoes, he’s wrapped up in the daily news. He’s looking confused, he’s asking me, “what should I do with my life.”


String me up in heaven.


If you think it’s funny, it’s not. I put a lot of thought into this trick.


I’m walking this star road and I’m hearing words no one even knows about. I’m finding where it goes, hanging upside down so my blood flows out.


String me up in heaven.


If you think it’s funny, I know it’s not. I put a lot of thought into this trick.


-


I saw a young man kill tonight. With two guns in his hands he took so many lives. I sat there as I cried, wishing I could turn back time.


If I make it off this earth alive, I’m going to want to wonder why. I know I don’t deserve to die, but neither did those who lost their lives. 


I’m going to take this prayer to the highest hill around and pray that you’ll heal the hearts of those who’ve been trampled down because what we need right now is more love from the heart. I know I can’t do it on my own, but this is a start.


I saw an old man offer up his life, a heroic and loving sacrifice. I sat there as I cried, a bond so strong he was willing to die. 

If I make it off this earth alive, I swear I’m going to try. Yeah, I’ll put up a fight. I’m going to live my life right.


Life’s not easy for anyone, so why do you want to make people cry? You should be more concerned with making people smile. Life is fleeting, everyone moment is just passing by. Wouldn’t you rather make someone feel worthwhile?


I’m going to take this prayer to the highest hill around.


-


I know I saw it with it with my two eyes, this ghost he was trying to steal my soul. Now I’m dead, but I’m free. This ghost and I became the best of friends. He calls me up, he says he’s made plans. I think he think that he’s still alive. He’s walking through me, talking to me now. Dare I tell him or let him find out? It’s a hard way to go when you find out you’re a ghost.


I tell you man, things feel alright when only your spirit is alive. Life moves so slow. I hear that time flies when you’re having fun. That’s why fun friends are jealous of the bored ones and that’s why I became a ghost. I’m tricking, slipping, sliding all round. I’m tricking, tipping, slipping the hounds. Because there’s no other way to go once you’ve found out you’re a ghost.


I’m a ghost.


-


Everybody is talking, they’re talking way too slow. I can’t take it anymore, I’m headed home. I can’t stay up late because I have lost my mind. Well, if I don’t get some sleep soon, I’m running out of time. There are things I want to do, there are things I want to be, but I can’t be nothing the way you’re treating me. You laid on the grass, right on your back and you stared straight ahead. You made out the shapes of all your favorite things and you laughed.


I’ve been working hard, I put in the time. I’m trying to have the time of my life, but you’re on my mind. But it all slipped away, the things i wanted to say. Everytime I see you, I’m going insane. You don’t know, but I think I’ve got to go. You’re riding your bike. And there’s no reason, I can’t think of reason, give me one good reason why you’re not here.


-


I wish I was more like my brother, the one that I’ve read so much about. His power, his healing, his perfect demeanor is something I’ve lived without all my life.


I wish I was more like my brother, the one I grew up with. He loves and supports me although I’m not deserving, he’s been my best friend all my life.


Favor after favor, he’s been the perfect neighbor living in my heart for sometime. Although we no longer share the same room, we still share a name, we share blood, we share sadness, we share joy, and we share love.


-


Oh keep talking, darling, and I hope you do. One of these days you’re going to run out of things to say. But, it don’t make no difference whether you do or don’t, because the lies you tell are telling your story well.


I’ve been trying to find something on my own. Searching, oh, for something I can’t describe. Well, I’ve got my own and I know you’ve got yours. Let’s take them all to our home.


I’ve found my way and all of this time it was right in front my face.


Well let’s just drive back east because I know you feel it. There’s no stopping us, there’s no turning around. I know you’ve got yours and the distance it grows. Time don’t matter, there’s no stopping us.


Time means nothing with you by my side. As long as you’re here and mine.


-


The coldest hour of the longest night, snow is falling under Logan streetlights and my heart is coming out of my chest. The words I’m singing and these words I’m thinking all got froze up when my head started sinking. Are you drinking alone again? 


An honest heart out on its own and all you need to do is come home to your friends, the ones who keep you alive. I miss the old, you know I do. When I think of those times I’m thinking of you and your dreams. You know, they could still come true. If you really want them to, they’ll come true. They’ll all come true.


-


God said, “move slow and take care as you go.” I moved too fast and now I’m off track, won’t you help me get back on the path? Want to, need to, got to get back to where I was before.


My dad said, “you know son, you did well now your job is done. You’ve got to move on, but don’t get stuck in a rut can be your coffin.” You know dad, I never said, but I’m so thankful for you always loving me.


Something in the way this world turns, it makes my stomach churn. Somehow I got the best of friends, they mean more to me


-


There’s people always trying to tell me what to do, trying and trying, but I never listen to them. If you’ve got some problems I’m going to leave them in your hands to solve. You want to teach me how to write and tell me how to speak, oh, Clementine, I know that you are sweet, but I happen to like the sour kind I’m scribbling now.


Oh, you tell me that you’re so sorry now. You want to repent for all the damage done. But honey I never believed, I never believed, never believed, I still don’t believe in you.


Long thoughts and contradictions and let’s see what you can do. All your verbosity is getting confused. Please don’t project your convolutions on me. And if you want to talk about the meanings of this song, oh honey girl, well you know I’ll play along, but that is not what I meant it’s not it at all.


Oh, you tell me you’re so sorry now, that you want to repent for all the damage done. But, I never believed, I never believed, never believed, I still don’t believe in you.


-


Oh no, my Lord, was it your son? Was he the only one? Oh no, my Lord, still having dark nights. My heart is on that line, my heart is on that line, don’t fail me this time, my heart is on the line.


Stained red, my guitar. My fingers playing melodies my memory had forgotten. Oh no, my Lord, if this is how it’s going to end you can count me out this time, I don’t need to be reminded, oh my heart is on the line, don’t fail me this time. I said my heart is on the line, oh my heart is on the line.


And though I’ve already said my goodbyes, I won’t change. If I just stay the same, stuck in fear, with this ghost nipping at my heals.


-


I’ve got a bad heart, it gets worse all the while and my thoughts stay the same. I cannot win. I love other people, I love myself even more, my actions are clear, but my thought process is poor.


Though my vision is good I cannot see in the dark. If someone is there, please tell me who. I’m trying so hard, just fighting these feelings, but I’ve got no reason to anymore.


I keep on moving, but I’ll never change. My heart hurts the same. I got to thinking about religion, religion is my friends. All my friends, my family.


Your eyes and your smile are there when I wake up you’re making this hard. My heart breaks. Temperate is good, fire is best, and carnal desire will do the rest. 


I keep on moving, but I never change. My heart breaks the same. I got to thinking about religion. My religion is my friends. All my friends, my family.


I feel it all on my back, my back breaks again. Guilt has helped me to relax when I get overwhelmed. I’m overwhelmed.


-


People talk a lot, but they’re talking so slow. People talk a lot, but what could they know about me. These people talk a lot, they’re always talking. People talk a lot.


I found my heart in a stone, I found a sword on a sleeve, I found my problems in a hole, and I want to go home. I built my whole body out of lies. I’ve built this soul out of tears. I filled the hole up with doubt and I plugged my ears.


People talk a lot, but they’re talking so slow. People talk a lot, but what could the know about me. These people talk a lot, they’re always talking. People talk a lot.


I dug my own shallow grave. I slept inside hollow trees. I woke up with the ghosts and I ran with the thieves. I scratched my story in my skin. I transcribed all my sins. I worked from dawn until dusk and I slept in the seas.


Oh my blood it turns to gin and I will drink it in. My blood it turns to gin and I will drink it. And all those people talk a lot, but they’re all talking so slow. These people talk a lot, but what could they know about me.

Can you help my unbelief? Take me down to the water and wash me away. If someone comes looking for me, tell them you have not seen me today.


And if my time does come, should I just run?


God this earth is beautiful, but people are such assholes, like me. If being good ain’t good enough, is there any other reason I should believe?


And if my time does come, should I just run?


Are you cold? I know you’re lying. Listen to this song and think of me. I know I will.

Harboring the wicked, walking with the weak. Following footsteps that my father showed to me. Lonely like my name, fallen, and lame. Burdensome like pain, tired, broken down.


They came to my house, they sat on my couch. I can’t get them out. I can’t get them out, no.

I am a liar, I’m brimming lies and I’m lying. I’m trying to hid inside my own mind to be what I’m not. I’m a fighter in the second round bout for the title, I’m throwing punches so wild to be what I’m not.


And I know I’m losing. What am I proving? I’m I’m only moving the wrong direction, move me closer to you.


I am a lion, I’m living outside in the wild, fighting for my survival to be what I’m not. I’m a diver, jumping so high, I’m flying. I’m crashing down into the fire to be what I’m not.


And I know I’m losing. What am I proving? I’m I’m only moving the wrong direction, move me closer to you.

I will shoulder these blues, like a canvas. I’ll walk away from these truths because I don’t understand. I thought I was brave, never feared the winding path, until those curves left my vision black, all in a cast, and I keep looking back.


I will shoulder these blues, like a trumpet. Deliberating and confused now that California’s been loosed. I thought I could sail on this one breeze that I had found, but that breeze just left me dry. It was a bird in the sky that brought me back to life. 


I will shoulder these blues, like a romantic. I no longer care for the news, I’ve got better things to do. I thought I could live my life decisively, but spreading doubt, like waiting rooms in my own mind, fallen out, and feeling the doubt.

The grass is wet and my feet froze through. I should replace these old shoes, or patch up the holes, but what’s the use? My feet will still get cold. I will rise up so early tomorrow to put my thoughts in a song. Write down how I feel as if I might forget. I have felt like this all year.


Problems still ensue. You can do your best, you can follow through. It won’t change what others do or nature’s pull on you.


A brick through the window with a note attached or a sign on the back of a truck. It says, “learn our language or get the fuck out!” When will this hatred end? I have fought my whole life to avoid the crossfire, but I’m still going to get burned in the end. Friends and family, yes, I have loved my share, but we will all die alone.


Problems still ensue. You can do your best, you can follow through. It won’t change what others do or nature’s pull on you.


Deliberating and confused because now it seems I have got to chose. Now that California's been loosed, what do I have to lose?

God, why’d you give your kids arms when all they seem to want to do with them is fight? Pushing and pull, knocking each other down. Is this really what you had in mind?


God, why’d you give your kids mouths when no one seems to know how to talk nice? Swearing and yelling, they’re bringing each other down. Is this really what you had in mind?


God, why’d you make me better than him? And God, why’d you fill me up with sin?


God, why’d you give me a heart when you know I’m not strong enough to fight through? What kind of fool do you think I am? Did you really think I’d never find out? 


God, why’d you make me better than him? And God, why’d you fill me up with sin?

I got a ride home from my friend. It’s been so long I don’t know if he remembers who I am. The only thing that I said on our drive is, “this is where I’m living,” and “thanks for the ride.”


He stopped his car outside of my house. He said, “there’s something I’d like to ask you about.” I said, “alright.” I always do. But that was the last word I remember hearing that night.


I saw my friend again last week. He said, “thanks so much for opening up to me.” But I didn’t know what I said, or if he was making it up inside of his head.

There are still parts of me I don’t know, parts of me I won’t find out until I go. There are still parts of me I don’t like, when I’m trying to be good, but my evil fights. There are still parts of me that I fear, when motives for my actions remain unclear. There are still parts of me that are good, when my thoughts are exactly what they should be.


Oh, oh man, I’ve got it bad. Oh, oh man, I’ve got it good.


There are still parts of me that are sick, parts of my brain where the fog is thick. There are still parts of me I need to fix, parts of my life that are amiss. There are still parts of me that I miss, mania’s not as bad as people think. There are still parts of me that are good, when my thoughts are exactly what they should be.


Oh, oh man, I’ve got it bad. Oh, oh man, I’ve got it good.

Don’t act like you don’t know me, I know you saw me and my dog. I stopped a while to talk to you, oh man, I croaked like a frog. Hey, I was wondering, you’re a big fish it seems. The only way I can catch you is to offer a wedding ring.


Have figured it out what I’m talking about? Does it make you feel good? Does it feel alright? Better tell me quick, before I die.

26.2 is just too far to go. Turn around and come back home. She’s a girl I think is worth fighting, but if she wants war, I’m not sure. She's feeling fuzzy flying solo. Careful my girl, don’t want you hurt. Don’t know what to do, I’m out here on my own. She left for reasons well said and unknown.


And when you kissed me that night, sorry, but I didn’t feel a thing. And though it all seemed so right, that was years and years ago. Now, I’m turning in all my chips. It’s time to call it quits.

I saw you in my dream last night and it was barstools just the same. I woke up wishing I could go back, pinpoint the day and try to change. Well, it’s been years, honey, since I’ve thought about those days, but I’d be lying if I said I was still trying, I’m still stuck waiting for the light to change.


I’ve been so lonely this winter.


And it’s cold, honey, it seems we all just up and split. Don’t know what I’d say given a proper chance to part ways, but I know I never did get it. And it’s hard, buddy, I used to look to you for solace. And now it’s been so long since I’ve used my phone I feel like I’d just be bother.


I’ve been so lonely this winter. 


If you could go back, would you do it just the same. I know I made mistakes, but I’d do it just the same.


So what now, baby? Can I call you and have it not be strange? And if I do, and it is, will you pretend it ain’t, and talk to me about those days?


I’ve been so lonely this winter.
